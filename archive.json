Thus, when Receiver presents the URL to Relay server, the Relay server can now re-compute and verify checksum stored vs computed. Having this mechanism in place we can reduce the surface of attacks where someone will try to mess up the mailbox identifier along with a secret and try to redirect Receiver into a different mailbox created by malicious actor that might contain some sort of exploit/shell code, etc. \r\n\r\n*NEW2: Another idea that I wanted to bring forward is integrity protection over content stored in the mailbox.\r\nWe can use a Secret as a Master Key(MK) and derive ENC and MAC Keys from that MK. Therefore, ENC will be used to protect content's confidentiality and MAC Key to generate(by Sender) cryptographic checksum that can be validated by Receiver upon content download.\r\n\r\nKey derivation scheme can benefit from randomness of mailbox identifier, so subject to discuss.

We have discussed the idea of key derivation based on the mailbox Identifier, but it seems not provide any actual security benefits. If the attacker can guess the mailbox Id, they still be able to both read the mailbox content and use the same identifier in key derivation...\r\nThus we still have 2 key attributes that guaranty security of the mailbox - a random unique mailbox Identifier and a secret based on strong cryptographic RNG.\r\n",
